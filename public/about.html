<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Currently working on becoming a Web Development with the help of current curriculum that I am learning here at Udemy. </p>

<p>In conjunction with learning Web Development, I have also been learning about the importance of Cyber Security and the role it's playing in our current society. I received a Cyber Security certificate from Thinkful. The course taught the fundamental foundations to becoming a security analysis.</p>

<p>I not only bring my Web Development skills, but my Cyber Security as well.</p>
